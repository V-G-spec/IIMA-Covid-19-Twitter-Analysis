# IIMA Covid-19 Twitter Analysis
Code for my internship at IIM Ahmedabad (June 2020 - July 2020) under the supervision of Professor [Chirantan Chatterjee](https://www.chirantanchatterjee.com/).  


## Aim
The aim of the project was to critique and interpret real-time twitter data over 50 days and its correlation with national political & demographic changes with respect to the Covid-19 situation.

## Contribution
* I worked with COVID-19 Migrant Sentiment Analysis based on twitter where we collected data, manually annotated tweets and applied ML models. 
* I applied several ML models and other classifiers (Multinomial, Bayes, SVC, Random Forest) as well as NLP Tools (TextBlob, Vader) using Python as the base language. 
* I repeated similar analysis for the Twitter COVID-19 Project where we created / cleaned / handled a big dataset (~100GB) by collecting data in real time. 
* To carry out the NLP analysis, I also conducted a brief literature review. And then, trained the BERT NLP Model on 1.4M tweets after incorporating pre-processing techniques to weed out hashtags/links etc. This model was then used on our data by transfer learning
* I also helped in creating several data science visualisations including using tagging data with geo-location.  
* Finally, a major part of the project was the tweet collection / segregating process which I automated using the twitter API, thus allowing us to collect large amounts of data every day with minimal intervention required.
